# IPQ PYNQ Utilities
This code is a subset of the PYNQ utilities developed by KIT-IPQ, with modifications to suit use in QICK.
While the original project is used mainly to configure the CLK104 daughterboard on the ZCU208/216, we are using the same code to configure the LMX2594 oscillator on the V2 RF board.

The original project can be found at https://github.com/kit-ipq/ipq-pynq-utils.
