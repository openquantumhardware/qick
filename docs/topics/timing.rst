Timing
======

* Every generator contains a timed FIFO queue.
  There is only one master clock time `t_master`, which is shared by all timed queues.

  * Treat :meth:`.QickProgram.trigger()` as a generator channel, i.e. equivalent to :meth:`.QickProgram.pulse()` in terms of clocks.

* The tproc executes commands as soon as possible, meaning it has no concept of the master time (aside from wait commands, explained later).
  It only cares about what point it is at in your code.
  There is a master time offset `t_off`, which is incremented by sync commands.
  When executed by the tproc, ``trigger(t)`` and ``pulse(t)`` commands are appended to the appropriate queue with a timestamp of ``t_off + t``.

* A generator plays pulses in the order received.
  It waits to play each pulse until the previous pulse is complete and the master clock time equals (or exceeds) the command timestamp.

* ``pulse(ch,t)`` will play the pulse at ``t`` relative to the clock as defined by the sync command that has been most recently executed by the tproc, UNLESS it is delayed by a wait command (the generator can't play a pulse before the tproc executes the command) or another pulse command (the generator can't cut one pulse short to play the next one).
  In that case, it will play at time ``t`` or at the end of the wait time/previous pulse, whatever is latest.

  * To make life easier, you can just always call ``pulse(ch, t=0)``, which will just play the pulse at the next earliest possible time. Then insert simple waits between pulses using ``sync_all(t=wait_time)``.

* wait commands pause the tproc (i.e. pauses execution of commands).
  They do not affect the master time.
  Any commands lower down in your code, even if scheduled for some time (defined by the master time) during the wait period, will execute, at the earliest, immediately after the end of the wait period.

  * wait commands are necessary to use with readout/data acquisition timing management, as the tproc does not know when pulses/readout finish and you need to force it to wait for readout to finish.
    In other words, you should have a wait at the end of a loop (or the tproc will tell the software to read data from the buffer too soon), or before a ``read`` command (e.g. for feedback).
    `This is the only reason to use wait commands.`

  * ``waiti(0, t)`` is the generic form of wait, which pauses the tproc until the master clock time equals ``t_off + t``. Note ``waiti`` has a channel argument, but the channel argument does nothing!

  * :meth:`.QickProgram.wait_all()` calculates the end of all readout pulses and waits until that time + ``t``.

* sync commands increment the master time offset (used by all gen channels).
  The effect is to push back the play time of subsequent commands by that increment.

  * ``synci(t)`` is the generic form of sync. ``sync(page, reg)`` reads a register, allowing for sweeps.

  * The smarter version :meth:`.QickProgram.sync_all()` compiles to a ``synci`` that pushes back the reference time to the end of the last pulse played + ``t``.
    The compiler doesn't recognize the effects of previous ``synci`` or ``sync`` commands when it does this calculation, so ``sync_all()`` should not be mixed with the simpler commands.

How to avoid timing problems
----------------------------

Timed instructions are executed in two steps: first when the control core of the tProcessor pushes the instruction into the timed queue, and second when the instruction pops off the timed queue.

* The control core executes all instructions in order and (except ``wait``/``waiti``) as quickly as possible.
  If you have a non-timed instruction with external effects, it will generally execute before the timed instructions before and after it.
  Specifically, programs (like the AveragerProgram framework we're using here) typically use ``memwi`` to update a data counter, and then read that counter to know how many data samples to get from the buffers - if the ``memwi`` happens before the readout is triggered or completed, you will read invalid data.

* If the instruction is pushed later than the specified time, it will execute later than specified - this can lead to variations in the relative timing of pulses and readout windows. You are responsible for keeping the control core running ahead of the instruction times.

Things you should do in your programs:

* Your initialization should contain a ``synci`` instruction which gives the tProcessor time to get ahead of the clock.

* Put a :meth:`.QickProgram.sync_all()` somewhere in your loop body, probably at the end. This ensures that you don't have pulses or readouts that exceed the loop length.

* Put a ``waiti`` instruction after the last readout in your loop body, to make sure the tProcessor doesn't prematurely update the data counter.

* Follow the ``waiti`` with a ``synci`` that exceeds the ``waiti``, to allow the tProcessor to get ahead of the clock.

* The last three points are automatically addressed if the last timed instruction in your loop body is a :meth:`.QickProgram.measure()` instruction that specifies ``wait=True`` and a nonzero ``syncdelay``.
