# Build a wheel and publish to PyPI when a pull request merges.

# We need access to the repo secrets, which are only available using the pull_request_target trigger.
# For security this requires us to use the repo HEAD and not the PR merge commit.
# But since this action only executes on merge, those are the same thing.
