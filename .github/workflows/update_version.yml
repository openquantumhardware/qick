# Automatically update the package version.
# The version has the format major.minor.PR, where PR is the number of the most recent pull request.
# This action runs automatically when a pull request is opened, or a commit is added to an open pull request.
# https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull_request
#
# It checks the version number against the PR number; if it does not match, the version number is updated in a new commit.
# The commit will be credited to the GitHub Actions user.
# https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/26560#discussioncomment-3252339
# 
# If you don't want this action to run (e.g. if you want a different version number for a certain PR), include [skip actions] in the commit message.
